# Medical Robotics Digital Twin: Simulation & Haptics

**Context:** Independent Research & Mercer XLab Core Infrastructure
**Status:** Architecture & Requirements Definition (Active Development)
**Timeline:** Jan 2026 – May 2026

## Project Overview
This repository contains the architecture and ROS 2 packages for a high-fidelity digital twin focused on surgical robotics. Built using NVIDIA Isaac Sim and ROS 2 Humble, the primary objective is to create a safe, simulated testbed for medical teleoperation. This environment bridges the gap between theoretical kinematics and real-time hardware control, allowing for the rapid integration and testing of varied haptic feedback devices.

Because the system is designed with a highly modular, hardware-agnostic architecture, the foundational hardware-integration phases (Phases 0–2) will be adopted as official educational robotics modules for the RPI Mercer XLab.

## Tech Stack
* **Simulation Environment:** NVIDIA Isaac Sim (Omniverse)
* **Middleware/Networking:** ROS 2 (Humble)
* **Languages:** Python, C++
* **Hardware Interfacing:** Standard Gamepad (XInput), Novint Falcon, 3D Systems Phantom Omni

## System Architecture & Development Roadmap
The development pipeline is structured to progressively scale from basic kinematic validation up to high-fidelity, 6-DOF force reflection and biological simulation.

### Phase 0: System Validation (Keyboard Teleoperation)
* **Objective:** Establish and verify the baseline network connection between the ROS 2 host and the Isaac Sim environment.
* **Mechanism:** Utilize standard `teleop_twist_keyboard` nodes to drive the digital twin's end-effector, ensuring the native inverse kinematics solvers (Lula) are functioning without hardware driver interference.

### Phase 1: Gamepad Integration (Xbox Controller)
* **Objective:** Introduce external USB hardware teleoperation.
* **Mechanism:** Map standard 2D joystick axes to the ROS 2 `/cmd_vel` topic utilizing the `joy` package.
* **Implementation Note:** The documentation and deployment of this phase currently serve as the highly scalable introductory robotics module for Mercer Lab students.

### Phase 2: Low-Fidelity Haptics & Rigid Contacts (Novint Falcon)
* **Objective:** Introduce 3-Degree-of-Freedom (DOF) spatial control and establish the baseline force-reflection loop.
* **Mechanism:** Resurrect legacy Novint Falcon drivers to interface with ROS 2, translating 3D Cartesian coordinates into spatial end-effector targets. Program virtual fixtures (rigid walls) within Isaac Sim to calculate collision forces and publish resistance data back to the Falcon's motors.
* **Implementation Note:** Serves as the advanced hardware module for the Mercer Lab curriculum.

### Phase 3: High-Fidelity Kinematics (Phantom Omni)
* **Objective:** Achieve 6-DOF teleoperation. 
* **Mechanism:** Upgrade the hardware interface to the Phantom Omni. Update the ROS 2 control nodes to process full spatial and rotational data (Pitch, Yaw, Roll) to drive the surgical end-effector with complete articulation.

### Phase 4: Soft-Body Physics & Biological Simulation
* **Objective:** Introduce active, variable force reflection mimicking human tissue.
* **Mechanism:** Transition from rigid virtual walls to soft-body physics (veins/tissue) in Isaac Sim. Actively calculate elastic and dynamic resistance data based on tissue deformation and feed it back to the user's hand via the Omni's haptic motors.

### Phase 5: Autonomous Diagnostics & Surgical Environment (Isaac for Healthcare)
* **Objective:** Finalize the hospital room digital twin and integrate volumetric diagnostic imaging.
* **Mechanism:** Render a photorealistic, physically accurate hospital environment utilizing Omniverse RTX. Simulate the kinematics of a virtual Computed Tomography (CT) scanner to evaluate patient anatomy. Utilize NVIDIA's MAISI (Medical AI and Simulation Infrastructure) to generate and process synthetic 3D CT volumes, allowing the system to actively identify and segment anatomical anomalies (e.g., tumors) for targeted teleoperated surgical removal.

### Phase 6: Targeted Intervention & Teleoperated Resection
* **Objective:** Execute a closed-loop surgical task utilizing the complete hardware and software pipeline.
* **Mechanism:** Combine the 6-DOF haptic force-reflection (Phase 4) with the diagnostic telemetry (Phase 5). The operator utilizes the Phantom Omni to navigate the virtual end-effector to the segmented anomaly. The simulation tracks instrument trajectory, applied force, and tissue deformation to calculate a "success metric" for the simulated tumor resection, ensuring healthy surrounding tissue is not compromised.
